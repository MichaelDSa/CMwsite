Implement a commenting protocol. Comments begin with a number between 0 and 5 signifying how important the change is.

0 - for anything trivial or changing the todo.txt or readme.txt contents. 
1 - simple progress: adding/modifying a function or adding some html
2 - more completed. New page added / Multiple pages added. Work is as simple as level 1, but more is completed.
3 - Achievement completed - like learning a new technique. New branch / merge still unnecessary.
4 - Subjectively more important than Level 3 / continuation of learning new technique.
5 - Completion/beginning: New branch or return to main branch is necessary.

Note: This is how I'm organizing myself for now. As I learn more about Git, I'll implement the native features that overtake this idea. I'm guessing tagging would do that.
