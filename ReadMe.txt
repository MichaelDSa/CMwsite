Implement a new commenting protocol in GIT. Commit comments begin with an number between 0 and 5 signifying how important the change is.

0 - for changing todo.txt contents, or read me contents, or anything trivial
1 - simple progress: adding/modifying a function or adding some html
2 - more completed. New page added / Multiple pages added. Work is as simple as level 1, but more is completed.
3 - Achievement completed - like learning a new technique. New branch / merge still unnecessary.
4 - Subjectively more important than Level 4 / continuation of learning new technique.
5 - New beginning / return to roots: either new branch is required, or a merge to the main branch is warranted.
